Not actually relevant to the page, but does anyone know if there are similar theorems about when a topological space is homeomorphic to a manifold?

Submetrizablity

Comment (03:40, 3 March 2007) — Taku: I am pretty sure that that the space is submetrizable means that it contains a metrizable subspace or the space is homeomorphic to such a space, but I couldn't find (by means of quick google search) a reference to back this. Does anyone confirm this? Without defining Submetrizablity we can't go deep into the metrizable problems in my opinion. (Reply link on Wikipedia)

Reply (14:01, 2 June 2007) — Hennobrandsma: A space is called submetrizable if it has a weaker metrizable topology. The Sorgenfrey line is an example: the usual topology on R is a weaker and metrizable topology.

Separation Axioms

Comment (15:14, 3 June 2008): Most texts, Dugundji being an example, consider normality to be a stronger separation axiom than regularity, not weaker. But then this is normality as T4 and regularity as T3. Without some clarification in this article, it isn't clear what Urysohn actually said.

Further, this article needs style editing—or is it just me who thinks articles on general topology should avoid sounding flippant?

Tychonoff's vs. Urysohn version

Comment (20:54, 24 October 2012): Under Tychonoff's assumptions X is in fact normal: second-countable implies Lindelöf, and Lindelöf + regular implies normal (this is Tychonoff's lemma). Tychonoff's contribution (his Lemma) was therefore more general than to just extend Urysohn's Metrization Theorem.

Comment (20:28, 16 June 2016) — anonymous: Hi guys, I'm a bit unclear on what the τ in the tuple (X, τ) is; can anyone shed some light on this? Do we approach this bracketed form similar to tuples in [measure theory](/broken/pages/415f975aba6ca866bd30e24a02e9bd3c3294a2ee)?

Reply (22:32, 16 June 2016) — Zfeinst: Assuming you are referring to the lead: τ refers to the topology on the space X under consideration. I hope this helps clarify. Definitely add in clarification to the text if you think this is unclear.

"Semi-metrizable" not defined

<summary>View discussion</summary>

Comment (11:27, 8 April 2020) — Tea2min: "Semi-metrizable"/"Semi-metrisable"/"Semimetrizeable" redirect to [Metrizable space](/broken/pages/2a3950509364f492186fa0062606941b56fff036), but semi-metrizability is not defined at the target page, and apparently never was, at least I didn't find it in the article history. Can someone please add the definition?
