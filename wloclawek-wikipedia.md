## History

Włocławek's site shows settlements from the late Bronze Age–early Iron Age and later Roman and early medieval traces. The town was founded in the 9th century; in the 10th century it became part of the early Polish state under the Piast dynasty. The oldest known mention appears in the 12th-century chronicle Gesta principum Polonorum (1110s). The name likely derives from the Old Polish male name Włodzisław.

In the 12th century Włocławek had a mint, customs chamber for river tolls on the Vistula and Zgłowiączka, a hospital (turn of 12th–13th c.), and a school first mentioned in 1215. The Diocese of Włocławek is documented from 1148.

Włocławek received city rights in 1255. During the 14th–15th centuries it was attacked several times by the Teutonic Knights (who called it Leslau). It belonged to the Brześć Kujawski Voivodeship within the Greater Poland Province. Nicolaus Copernicus may have attended the cathedral school at the end of the 15th century.

### Modern era

Włocławek prospered from river transport and tolls on grain sent to Gdańsk, timber exports, and brewing. In 1569 a theological seminary was founded; Baroque Franciscan buildings were established in the 17th century.

The city suffered during the Swedish Deluge (1657) and the Great Northern War (1707). After the Second Partition (1793) it passed to Prussia, then the Duchy of Warsaw (1807), and later Congress Poland under Russian rule (1815). Polish insurgents were active in the January Uprising (1863–1864). The city was damaged in World War I. After 1918 it returned to Poland; in 1920 it was defended against Soviet forces.

### World War II

German forces occupied Włocławek on 14 September 1939, annexing it to Reichsgau Posen/Wartheland. Early massacres and repression targeted Jews, clergy, teachers, and other Poles. Synagogues were burned and Einsatzgruppe III carried out mass arrests (Intelligenzaktion). Many priests and seminarians were deported to Dachau; several local clergy are now among the 108 Blessed Polish Martyrs of World War II. Large parts of the Grzywno district were destroyed and inhabitants murdered or expelled; much of the Jewish population (over 10,000 before the war) was exterminated in ghettos and camps such as Chełmno and Auschwitz.

Soviet forces captured the city on 20 January 1945; the city suffered further looting and one third of it was destroyed. Factories and workshops were rebuilt in the postwar decades.

### Recent period

Important modern industries include chemicals, furniture, and food processing. A dam built in 1969 created the Włocławek Reservoir and regulates the Vistula. From 1975–1999 the city was capital of Włocławek Voivodeship. In 2012 the city became part of a Special Economic Zone (Włocławek Economic Development Area – Industrial and Technological Park). The Catholic priest Jerzy Popiełuszko, associated with the Solidarity movement, was murdered in 1984 and his body recovered from the Włocławek Reservoir.

## The Jewish community in Włocławek

The Jewish population grew from 218 (1820) to about 13,500 (1939). The town had Jewish schools, yeshivas, and sports clubs. Under German occupation Jews were forced to wear yellow badges (one of the earliest places to impose this), experienced murders from 1939, and a ghetto was established in November 1940. Large deportations occurred to Łódź and to extermination at Chełmno; the remaining ghetto population was sent to Chełmno in 1942. After the war some Jews returned, but by the late 1960s the community had effectively disappeared. Memorials and a Jewish cemetery remain.
