Eliza Rosanna Gilbert (17 February 1821 – 17 January 1861), better known by the stage name Lola Montez (/moʊnˈtɛz/), was an Irish dancer and actress who became famous as a Spanish dancer, courtesan, and mistress of King Ludwig I of Bavaria, who made her Gräfin (Countess) von Landsfeld. At the start of the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states she was forced to flee. She proceeded to the United States via Austria, Switzerland, France and London, returning to work as an entertainer and lecturer.

## Biography

### Early life

Eliza Rosanna Gilbert was born into an Anglo-Irish family, daughter of Ensign Edward Gilbert and Elizabeth ("Eliza") Oliver (daughter of Charles Silver Oliver). Their residence was the former Castle Oliver. Eliza was born in Grange, County Sligo. The family lived in Boyle, County Roscommon, until early 1823, then journeyed to Liverpool and departed for India on 14 March.

Published reports of her birthdate differ; for many years she claimed to be born in Limerick in 1818, but a baptismal certificate established her birth in Grange on 17 February 1821. She was baptised at St. Peter's Church in Liverpool on 16 February 1823 while en route to her father's post in India.

Shortly after arriving in India, Edward Gilbert died of cholera. Her mother soon married Lieutenant Patrick Craigie. Eliza was sent back to Britain for schooling, staying with Craigie's father in Montrose, then was moved to Sunderland and later to a school in Camden Place (now Camden Crescent), Bath.

In 1837, 16-year-old Eliza eloped with Lieutenant Thomas James. The couple separated five years later in Calcutta, and she became a professional dancer under a stage name. Her London debut as "Lola Montez, the Spanish dancer" was in June 1843; notoriety hampered her career there, so she left for the continent, finding success in Paris and Warsaw. During this period she was regarded by many as a courtesan.

## Life as a courtesan

![Portrait of Lola Montez (1847) by Joseph Karl Stieler](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Stieler_-_Lola_Montez_\(Sch%C3%B6nheitengalerie\).jpg/250px-Stieler_-_Lola_Montez_\(Sch%C3%B6nheitengalerie\).jpg) ![Gouache by Carl Buchner, 1847](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/C_Buchner_-_Lola_Montez_\(Guache_1847_PhS115\).jpg/250px-C_Buchner_-_Lola_Montez_\(Guache_1847_PhS115\).jpg)

In 1844, performing in Paris, Montez met Franz Liszt and entered Parisian literary circles, becoming acquainted with George Sand and Alexandre Dumas. She revitalised her career via a romance with Alexandre Dujarrier; the relationship ended after Dujarrier was killed in a duel.

In 1846 Montez arrived in Munich where she became the mistress of King Ludwig I of Bavaria. Ludwig made her Countess of Landsfeld and Baroness of Rosenthal on 25 August 1847 and granted her a large annuity. Montez exercised political influence, promoting liberalism and anti-Catholic positions and attacking the Jesuits. Her influence led to political dismissals and tensions culminating in the university closure at Ludwig's insistence. In March 1848, with revolutionary pressure mounting, the university was reopened, Ludwig abdicated in favour of his son Maximilian II, and Montez fled Bavaria.

After time in Switzerland, France and London, she married George Trafford Heald in late 1848; because her divorce from Thomas James did not permit remarriage while the other spouse lived, the marriage led to a bigamy action and the couple fled. The relationship ended; Heald later died of tuberculosis. In 1851 Montez went to the United States, initially successfully rehabilitating her image.

## American career

![Lola Montez, daguerreotype by Southworth & Hawes, 1851](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Lola_Montez_-_1851.jpg/250px-Lola_Montez_-_1851.jpg) ![Caricature Departure for America](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Lola_Montez_Caricature_Departure_for_America.jpg/250px-Lola_Montez_Caricature_Departure_for_America.jpg)

From 1851 to 1853 Montez performed as a dancer and actress in the eastern United States, including a play called Lola Montez in Bavaria. In May 1853 she arrived in San Francisco, where her performances caused a sensation. She married Patrick Hull in July and moved to Grass Valley, California, in August; the marriage soon failed. A doctor named as co-respondent in the divorce suit was murdered shortly thereafter.

Montez lived in Grass Valley for nearly two years. Her restored residence is California Historical Landmark No. 292. She provided dancing lessons and encouraged aspiring entertainer Lotta Crabtree.

## Australia tour

In June 1855 Montez left the U.S. to tour Australia, entertaining miners at the gold diggings. She arrived in Sydney on 16 August 1855.

In September 1855 in Melbourne she performed the erotic Spider Dance at the Theatre Royal, raising her skirts sufficiently to show she wore no underclothing, provoking public outcry and financial losses for the theatre. In Ballarat she attacked editor Henry Seekamp with a whip after a bad review. At Castlemaine in April 1856 she was encored for her Spider Dance by 400 diggers but angered some of the audience after insulting them. She departed for San Francisco on 22 May 1856; on the return voyage her manager and purported lover was lost at sea after going overboard.

## Later life in the U.S.

Montez attempted theatrical comebacks in various U.S. cities without lasting success. She found a new profession as a lecturer in the United States, Britain, and Ireland, delivering talks on topics such as "The Comic Aspects of Love" and "Wits and Women of Paris." In 1857 she arranged to deliver a series of moral lectures written by Reverend Charles Chauncey Burr. She also published her letters and the book The Arts of Beauty, or Secrets of a Lady's Toilet, with Hints to Gentlemen on the Art of Fascinating.

She spent her last days doing rescue work among women, including work with women trying to leave prostitution. A November 1859 report described her living quietly and occasionally hosting Bohemian friends.

## Burial

Accounts differ about Montez's cause and year of death. One source claims tertiary syphilis effects by 1860; another states she died of syphilis at age 39 on 17 January 1861 and is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, where her tombstone lists her age as 42. A third source describes death from pneumonia at age 40.
