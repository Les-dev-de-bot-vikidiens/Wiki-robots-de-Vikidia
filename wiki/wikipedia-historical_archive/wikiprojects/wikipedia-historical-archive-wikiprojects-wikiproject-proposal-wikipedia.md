## WikiProject proposal

This proposal was written by [Manning Bartlett](/broken/pages/2464488724ea90e046a9fb4069f8e2be6985fce6).

This is a proposal for all and sundry to read and consider. Because of its length, the author chose not to include it in the general "suggestions" page, although a link has been placed there.

The author’s field of professional expertise is Metadata Management (information about information). He adapted a concept from that field and tentatively titled it a "WikiProject". A "Project" is defined as a comprehensive catalogue of related information entities (examples: "Countries of the World", "Famous Scientists", "Games and Sports", etc.). A WikiProject is a metadata page that serves as a reference point for those who wish to be involved in a specific subject area.

### Structural principles for a WikiProject page

* defines the scope of the particular project
* establishes the formatting conventions for individual entries (e.g., how each individual entry should be structured — in a biographical entry: relevant dates, notable achievements, etc.)
* establishes the formatting conventions for hierarchical descendants (e.g., guidelines on how to define "Prime Ministers of New Zealand" as a descendant of "Prime Minister" as a descendant of "Political Leader")
* (optional) define "Minimum standards" — a WikiProject can lay down the principles by which an individual entry can be considered to have achieved a minimum standard of completion (dynamic and consensual; not locking pages)
* lists participating contributors
* provides subject-specific forums

Note: pages like these already exist in an ad hoc sense (for example, Tree of life). This concept seeks to standardize and formalize the approach, and to segregate "information" from "management of the information."

### Advantages (as proposed)

* Standardization of look and feel — subject-specific conventions instead of trying to apply a one-size-fits-all standard
* Decreases volume of redirects by having a consistent hierarchical descendant schema
* Allows development of special-interest communities within Wikipedia
* Permits strategic planning and consensual discussion by centralizing talk forums
* Allows controlled dynamic evolution — a central-but-consensual management point
* Provides a convention for information management — where to go to find frameworks and discussion
* A resource for standards and comprehensiveness — formalizes attempts to document missing content and areas needing attention
* Provides a forum for "endorsement" without closing editorial freedom — projects can define minimum standards and document entries that meet them

### What a WikiProject is not

* It is not a place for subject information; it is for the management of entries within a subject area.
* It is not rigid in hierarchical management — hierarchies are arbitrary and used for management rather than as a definitive schema of knowledge.

### Is it worth the effort?

The value of the metadata management model increases with the number of contributors. For small teams (few contributors) it can add overhead; for larger groups it reduces fragmentation, duplication, and rework.

A sample WikiProject page is provided below for consideration.

### Example page

Title: WikiProject Musical Instruments

* Scope: This WikiProject aims to catalogue all known musical instruments.
* Parentage: child WikiProject of [Music](/broken/pages/707477caa0617a0c5fea9e607acb02ae997eb6be)
* Descendant WikiProjects: No descendant WikiProjects defined
* Formatting: discussion of how each musical instrument entry is to be formatted; sample given (e.g., Name, alternate names, description, evolution, relatives, see also, etc.)
  * TALK section related to formatting
* Hierarchy definition: Instruments can be placed into one or more categories — orchestral, brass, wind, stringed, ethnic (categories not mutually exclusive)
  * TALK section related to hierarchy definition
* Directory of Participants
* General Strategy and Discussion forum

***

The idea is that sample structures are fluid and will evolve by "proposal — consensual discussion — consolidation." The framework is intended to be available whenever someone thinks a project is needed, rather than forcing immediate adoption.

I like this idea, and I think it could work with Magnus's additional namespaces to allow for using the wiki as an organizational tool for WikiTeams to use to structure their activity on the Wikipedia.

I'm probably the guy doing the most work on [sports](/broken/pages/8c05b680fc5fa68b6bf03d9692593329f66716fa) at the moment, and my current goal is to have a couple of paragraphs describing the origins, basic outline of play, elite championships, and geographic representation of every sport I can. I could apply your organisational tools to my current work, but I'm unconvinced that the overhead is worth it. Would you be interested in helping me give it a try for sports?

<summary>Author reply — Manning Bartlett</summary>

Sports is an obvious candidate. I'd be delighted to test the methodology there. I'll create the framework and you provide the principles.

Note on overhead: For fewer than about five contributors, the WikiProject idea may add unnecessary complexity. Its value grows with the number of contributors.

Create WikiProjects either a priori based on a main category scheme, or let them evolve organically. I favor a middle way — one WikiProject for each main category in the HomePage scheme, and allow subprojects as needed.

Not sure yet. I think setting more specific content rules is premature; it might discourage people. More formal organization and standardization is better done after we have lots of content to organize and standardize. But I'm intrigued.

Agree it is not appropriate until there is a critical mass of participants and content. The framework is a methodology that can be employed whenever someone decides one is needed; it also avoids reinventing schemas each time.

No objections. Sample articles and templates to follow are good so long as people aren't taken to task for not following them yet. Thanks for jumping in!

We discussed metadata issues previously. I proposed similar metadata patterns and teamwork between Wikipedias; earlier responses were not encouraging and Larry Sanger opposed it at the time. (See links provided by the commenter.)

<summary>Author reply — Manning Bartlett</summary>

Larry opposes anything which "forces" people to do things a certain way. My ideas are about an organizational framework that can be adopted when wanted. The best idea is calling it "WikiProject" — memorable and unlikely to conflict with article names.
