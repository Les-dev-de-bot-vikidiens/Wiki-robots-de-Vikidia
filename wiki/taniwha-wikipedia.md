In [Māori mythology](/broken/pages/f3d24b38c7f0a93b77c4f1579763a9c64f825dea), **taniwha** (Māori pronunciation: [ˈtaniɸa](/broken/pages/64c8e538af030fb7709ecb28ccd1a3a6a5f7d8f4)) are large supernatural beings that live in deep pools in rivers, dark caves, or in the sea, especially in places with dangerous currents or deceptive breakers (giant waves). They may be considered highly respected [kaitiaki](/broken/pages/5fcc7949cc04a58ec9feed272d5a6b6d5cef80eb) (protective [guardians](/broken/pages/f48e9705ad5fc6dff257a5fc22d360e6cc7e25c0)), or in some traditions as dangerous, predatory beings that, for example, would kidnap women to have as wives.

## Etymology and Pacific analogues

Linguists have reconstructed the word _taniwha_ to Proto-Oceanic _tanifa_, meaning "shark species". In [Tongan](/broken/pages/de83d63cfcf6a92f55420b3b6625a2435d02b58b) and [Niuean](/broken/pages/fb75461478e5afa0e65f94306bd01a48a411fe2b), _tenifa_ refers to a large dangerous shark, as does the [Samoan](/broken/pages/ac82ff522ada2778369fc5ae746dd495e7767387) _tanifa_; the [Tokelauan](/broken/pages/46a93c1b6ac48288cc372447a51580cc7dafab26) _tanifa_ is a sea-monster that eats people. In most other [Polynesian languages](/broken/pages/aac14b6af6afa5ec358b590c087139129c8ccc6f), the cognate words refer to sharks or simply fish.[\[2\]](taniwha-wikipedia.md#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPolynesian_Lexicon_Project_Online-2)[\[3\]](taniwha-wikipedia.md#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHooper1994196-3)

Some anthropologists state that the taniwha has analogues within other [Polynesian cosmologies](/broken/pages/0b61bb25a82e329894736ffd00254bfbf00868e2). The Hawaiian _moʻo_ (or Moho) — reptilian deities — share characteristics with taniwha such as being both protector and harmful to humans, shape-shifting, and so on.[\[4\]](taniwha-wikipedia.md#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJ%C3%B8n200785-4)[\[5\]](taniwha-wikipedia.md#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWianecki2020-5)

At sea, a taniwha often appears as a [whale](/broken/pages/ea3cc258337d61429f5d974638b3248f864d718f) or a large shark (e.g., [southern right whale](/broken/pages/5d68465d78fa6faba4e4c81ad1244dff26630d67) or [whale shark](/broken/pages/6a5a10652e621187208e69240fce7beba5339924)), and compare the Māori name for the [great white shark](/broken/pages/72251dc573439b82e76854557c046dc717a30bc2): _mangō-taniwha_. In inland waters, they may be whale-like in size but look more like a [gecko](/broken/pages/9c768cefccd615f275f241aa3ca647a42eef35d4) or a [tuatara](/broken/pages/b5e2576aa4aa7c76e86ecbdd89d760f376aba060), often with a row of spines along the back. Other forms include a floating log with disconcerting behaviour. Some can tunnel through the earth, uprooting trees; legends credit certain taniwha with creating harbours by carving channels to the ocean (for example, Wellington’s harbour, [Te Whanganui-a-Tara](/broken/pages/35ce1ae08e571d165d54c3313f89f1d71c82530e), was reputedly carved by two taniwha). Lake Waikaremoana is also said to have been carved by taniwha. Some taniwha allegedly caused landslides beside lakes or rivers.

Taniwha can be male or female. The taniwha [Āraiteuru](/broken/pages/60ce05d84a9c8270854d1638a072542e48f14cff) is said to have arrived in New Zealand with early voyaging canoes; her eleven sons are credited with creating various branches of the [Hokianga Harbour](/broken/pages/4580b20eda23e57def1b259be193c6d54987548f).[\[10\]](taniwha-wikipedia.md#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOrbell1998184-185-10)[\[11\]](taniwha-wikipedia.md#cite_note-11)

## As guardians

Most taniwha have associations with tribal groups; each group may have its own taniwha. The taniwha Ureia (pictured above) was associated as a guardian with the Māori people of the [Hauraki district](/broken/pages/f301a3bd960186b12ce18b804ed9dd0a7d9fcb57). Many taniwha arrived from [Hawaiki](/broken/pages/21ce06f77afaee5b5bf4a74debeed5e16551e57e) as guardians of particular ancestral canoes; once in [Aotearoa](../aotearoa-wikipedia.md), they protected the descendants of the crew. The origins of some taniwha are unknown.

When accorded respect, taniwha usually acted well towards their people: warning of enemies (via a priest medium), saving people from drowning, and so on. Because they lived in dangerous or gloomy places, people placated taniwha with offerings (often a green twig and an incantation) when passing near their lairs. At harvest, the first [kūmara](/broken/pages/a0f08834b747f15f4b51667914cdec2851145a61) or the first [taro](/broken/pages/78804de2a30894876cbce0ef2c2201cf27ccc88d) was often presented to the taniwha.[\[8\]](taniwha-wikipedia.md#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOrbell1998149-150-8)

Arising from their guardian role, the word "taniwha" can also refer to chiefs. The Tainui saying "Waikato taniwha rau" (Waikato of a hundred chiefs) plays on this double meaning.[\[12\]](taniwha-wikipedia.md#cite_note-12)

Author [Witi Ihimaera](/broken/pages/4d09463da28fc4502e37d19c45b2372b44fece3b) says he has a female kaitiaki taniwha named Hine Te Ariki who lives in the [Waipaoa River](/broken/pages/ff42d15c5dbe849053bc0e2318d977af382b4e35).[\[13\]](taniwha-wikipedia.md#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKeane2009-13)

## As notorious monsters

In their guardian role, taniwha enforced [tapu](/broken/pages/50f5f87a6e62b641768c68e463bd42368f187377) and punished violations. They were especially dangerous to people from other tribes. Many legends tell of battles with taniwha both on land and at sea, often after a taniwha attacked and ate someone from an unrelated tribe. Humans in the stories eventually outwit and defeat the taniwha. Many are described as lizard-like; some accounts describe slayers cutting up and eating the beasts.[\[14\]](taniwha-wikipedia.md#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBest193449-14)

When the taniwha Hotu-puku was killed, his stomach reportedly contained whole, undigested bodies and various possessions — a list repeated in many taniwha stories.[\[8\]](taniwha-wikipedia.md#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOrbell1998149-150-8)[\[15\]](taniwha-wikipedia.md#cite_note-15)

Some taniwha were tamed rather than killed. For example, the taniwha Kaiwhare was tamed by Tāmure of Hauraki, who used a magical mere/pounamu; Kaiwhare thereafter lived on kōura (crayfish) and wheke (octopus).[\[16\]](taniwha-wikipedia.md#cite_note-FOOTNOTEReed2004288-289-16)

Ngārara Huarau is a taniwha from northern South Island myths; in most versions he eats villagers and captures a young woman. He is eventually enticed to a feast, ambushed, and killed; his tail detaches at death and is thrown into a body of water (in some versions landing at the pool at the base of [Wainui Falls](/broken/pages/72e53f9a391688d7b209f2bfd69251933df53b7a)).[\[17\]](taniwha-wikipedia.md#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMitchellMitchell200423-25-17)

## Relationships with people

Sometimes a person who had dealings with taniwha during life might become a taniwha after death (e.g., Te Tahi-o-te-rangi). Tūheita, an ancestor who drowned, became a taniwha despite no prior dealings. Human–taniwha relationships sometimes formed through marriage: Hine-kōrako was a female taniwha who married a human man, and [Pania](/broken/pages/5f7348843d66de19792132a45d96ee7197c68683) was a woman from the sea who married a human and bore a taniwha.[\[18\]](taniwha-wikipedia.md#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOrbell1998150-18)

In "The Taniwha of [Kaipara](/broken/pages/45bbda099864da60248469fa1442bba76e9ab1c0)" legend, three sisters are chased by a taniwha; one beautiful sister is captured and bears six sons (three like their father, three human). The human sons learn warfare and kill their taniwha brothers and father, then return home.[\[19\]](taniwha-wikipedia.md#cite_note-FOOTNOTEReed2004285-286-19)

## Modern usage

Taniwha have featured in New Zealand news—referenced in court cases and legal negotiations.[\[4\]](taniwha-wikipedia.md#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJ%C3%B8n200785-4) Beliefs in taniwha can cause controversy; however, views have shifted and they are sometimes recognised as indicators of natural hazards.[\[20\]](taniwha-wikipedia.md#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKingsbury2022-20)

In 2002, [Ngāti Naho](/broken/pages/9457e56bf6851b3ba3cbec5352eeba92229d843b) successfully ensured part of [State Highway 1](/broken/pages/1b2e83acd9e22b1b5a174eac160fa06846e2b5f0) was rerouted to protect the abode of their protector taniwha, described as a large white eel; Transit New Zealand negotiated concessions to ensure the taniwha were respected.[\[21\]](taniwha-wikipedia.md#cite_note-FOOTNOTETelevision_New_Zealand2002-21) Some journalists have criticised such deals as secretive and obstructive.[\[22\]](taniwha-wikipedia.md#cite_note-FOOTNOTERudman2007-22)

In 2001 a proposed [Northland prison](/broken/pages/3772e129004158b2f76476ae99c72ce5f4cacc50) site at [Ngawha](/broken/pages/31cc9e98a563dec0670a299ed190c07e0286fe50) was eventually approved through the courts despite taniwha-related controversy.[\[23\]](taniwha-wikipedia.md#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJ%C3%B8n200786-23)

Māori academic [Ranginui Walker](/broken/pages/cc5ce2924eddc4b2d31065596d071bc49730f503) suggested that in modern times taniwha function as a coping mechanism for some Māori—an indication of being troubled rather than literal creatures in the water.[\[24\]](taniwha-wikipedia.md#cite_note-FOOTNOTECorbett2002-24)

In 2021, New Zealand’s Minister of Foreign Affairs [Nanaia Mahuta](/broken/pages/71e71e9c20587c5067ab6a3250c7beae9757592f) characterised [China–New Zealand relations](/broken/pages/1d764752211ef65283c2180f65fe4f39615089ab) as the relationship between a taniwha and a dragon.[\[25\]](taniwha-wikipedia.md#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMahuta2021-25)
