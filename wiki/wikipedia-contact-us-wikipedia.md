Thank you for your interest in contacting Wikipedia. Before proceeding, some important disclaimers:

1. **Wikipedia has no central editorial board.** Contributions are made by a large number of volunteers at their own discretion. Edits are neither the responsibility of the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Home) (the organisation that hosts the site) nor of its staff.
2. Generally, the agent who responds to an email request will not make edits on your behalf.
3. Disagreements with content will not be resolved via email. Use the [Edit Request Wizard](/broken/pages/c7d2a02f9414726aa1f3797d5a54e98b16555d17) to propose specific changes to an article.
4. Although Wikipedia was co-founded by [Jimmy Wales](/broken/pages/070a3f0fa7e578e9188cc6c1ea93e4412f39bd2c), he is not personally responsible for our content.
5. If you have questions about the _concept_ of Wikipedia rather than a specific problem, the [About Wikipedia](wikipedia-about-wikipedia.md) page may help.
6. If you want to ask other users for help with editing or using Wikipedia, stop by the [Teahouse](/broken/pages/4d3ff73164b9e8bf66078f5c3695f59db67a0fe1), Wikipedia's [live help channel](/broken/pages/59776893f87a74ed42a6dbbd4888247ea02f4c06), or the [help desk](/broken/pages/853d036a16e66aec68073ab04d1b9ebe2764c911) to ask someone for assistance.
7. If you disagree with an article's content, or are involved in a content dispute, see [Dispute resolution](/broken/pages/df7b4b1b8be2138e6fe2fd9cc42963602cdae268).
