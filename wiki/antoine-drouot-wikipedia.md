## Biography

Born in Nancy, the son of a baker, Drouot trained as an artilleryman and took part in the battles of the French Revolution, rising through the ranks to be a captain of artillery at the Battle of Hohenlinden in 1800.\[^5]

He had an illustrious career during the Napoleonic Wars, notably at Wagram (1809) and Borodino (1812). For his conduct at Lützen and Bautzen in 1813, where he commanded the artillery of the Imperial Guard, he was promoted to general of division and became aide-de-camp to Emperor Napoleon.\[^5]

Drouot accompanied Napoleon into exile on Elba (1814–1815) and was appointed governor of the island.\[^5] He returned to France with Napoleon in 1815 and served with the Imperial Guard during the Hundred Days. On the eve of the Battle of Waterloo he took command of the Imperial Guard when Marshal Mortier fell ill. He was with Napoleon near the end of the battle and left the field with him; later he served as commandant of the Imperial Guard in Paris after Napoleon's second abdication.\[^5]\[^6]

After the surrender of Paris and the restoration of King Louis XVIII, Drouot stood trial for treason. He defended himself successfully, was acquitted, and was granted a state pension. In retirement he supported veterans of the Imperial Guard until his death in 1847.\[^7]

## Assessment

In Nouvelle Biographie Générale, Ch. Héquet wrote that France was astonished in 1814 to learn that she had possessed for a long time "the best officer of artillery in Europe."\[^5] Napoleon called Drouot "le Sage de la Grande Armée" (the sage of the Grand Army).\[^5]

Drouot's name is inscribed on the western pillar of the Arc de Triomphe.
