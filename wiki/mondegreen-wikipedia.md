Mondegreen

A mondegreen (/ˈmɒndɪˌɡriːn/) is a mishearing or misinterpretation of a phrase in a way that gives it a new meaning. Mondegreens are most often created by a person listening to a poem or a song; the listener, being unable to hear a lyric clearly, substitutes words that sound similar and make some kind of sense. The American writer Sylvia Wright coined the term in 1954, recalling a childhood memory of her mother reading the Scottish ballad "The Bonnie Earl o' Moray", and mishearing the words "laid him on the green" as "Lady Mondegreen".

"Mondegreen" was included in the 2000 edition of the Random House Webster's College Dictionary, and in the Oxford English Dictionary in 2002. Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary added the word in 2008.

Etymology

In a 1954 essay in Harper's Magazine, Sylvia Wright described how, as a young girl, she misheard the last line of the first stanza from the ballad "The Bonnie Earl o' Moray" (from Thomas Percy's 1765 book Reliques of Ancient English Poetry). She wrote:

> When I was a child, my mother used to read aloud to me from Percy's Reliques, and one of my favorite poems began, as I remember:
>
> Ye Highlands and ye Lowlands,
>
> Oh, where hae ye been?
>
> They hae slain the Earl Amurray,
>
> And Lady Mondegreen.

The correct lines are, "They hae slain the Earl o' Moray / And laid him on the green." Wright explained the need for a new term:

> The point about what I shall hereafter call mondegreens, since no one else has thought up a word for them, is that they are better than the original.

Psychology

People are more likely to notice what they expect rather than things that are not part of their everyday experiences; this is known as confirmation bias. A person may mistake an unfamiliar stimulus for a familiar and more plausible version. For example, to consider a well-known mondegreen in the song "Purple Haze", one may be more likely to hear Jimi Hendrix singing that he is about to kiss this guy than that he is about to kiss the sky. Similarly, if a lyric uses words or phrases that the listener is unfamiliar with, or in an uncommon sentence structure, they may be misheard as using more familiar terms.

The creation of mondegreens may be driven in part by cognitive dissonance; the listener finds it psychologically uncomfortable to listen to a song and not make out the words. Steven Connor suggests that mondegreens are the result of the brain's constant attempts to make sense of the world by making assumptions to fill in the gaps when it cannot clearly determine what it is hearing. Connor sees mondegreens as the "wrenchings of nonsense into sense". This dissonance will be most acute when the lyrics are in a language in which the listener is fluent.

On the other hand, Steven Pinker has observed that mondegreen mishearings tend to be less plausible than the original lyrics, and that once a listener has "locked in" to a particular misheard interpretation of a song's lyrics, it can remain unquestioned, even when that plausibility becomes strained (see mumpsimus). Pinker gives the example of a student "stubbornly" mishearing the chorus to "Venus" ("I'm your Venus") as "I'm your penis", and being surprised that the song was allowed on the radio. The phenomenon may, in some cases, be triggered by people hearing "what they want to hear", as in the case of the song "Louie Louie": parents heard obscenities in the Kingsmen recording where none existed.

James Gleick states that the mondegreen is a distinctly modern phenomenon. Without the improved communication and language standardization brought about by radio, he argues that there would have been no way to recognize and discuss this shared experience. Just as mondegreens transform songs based on experience, a folk song learned by repetition often is transformed over time when sung by people in a region where some of the song's references have become obscure. A classic example is "The Golden Vanity", which contains the line "As she sailed upon the lowland sea". British immigrants carried the song to Appalachia, where later generations of singers, not knowing what the term lowland sea refers to, transformed it over generations from "lowland" to "lonesome".

Examples

In songs

The national anthem of the United States is highly susceptible to the creation of mondegreens, two in the first line. Francis Scott Key's "The Star-Spangled Banner" begins with the line "O say can you see, by the dawn's early light". This has been misinterpreted as "José, can you see" countless times. The second half of the line has been misheard as well, as "by the donzerly light", or other variants. This has led to many people believing that "donzerly" is an actual word.

Religious songs, learned by ear (and often by children), are another common source of mondegreens. The most-cited example is "Gladly, the cross-eyed bear" (from the line in the hymn "Keep Thou My Way" by Fanny Crosby and Theodore E. Perkins: "Kept by Thy tender care, gladly the cross I'll bear"). Jon Carroll and many others quote it as "Gladly the cross I'd bear"; note that the confusion may be heightened by the unusual object-subject-verb (OSV) word order of the phrase. The song "I Was on a Boat That Day" by Old Dominion features a reference to this mondegreen.

Mondegreens expanded as a phenomenon with radio, and, especially, the growth of rock and roll (and even more so with rap). Among the most-reported examples are:

### "There's a bathroom on the right"

Misheard version: "There's a bathroom on the right"

Original lyric: "There's a bad moon on the rise"\
Song: "Bad Moon Rising" — Creedence Clearwater Revival
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### "’Scuse me while I kiss this guy"

Misheard version: "’Scuse me while I kiss this guy"

Original lyric: "’Scuse me while I kiss the sky"\
Song: "Purple Haze" — The Jimi Hendrix Experience
{% endstep %}

### "The girl with colitis goes by"

Misheard version: "The girl with colitis goes by"

Original lyric: "The girl with kaleidoscope eyes"\
Song: "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" — The Beatles
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

Both Creedence's John Fogerty and Hendrix eventually acknowledged these mishearings by deliberately singing the "mondegreen" versions of their songs in concert.

"Blinded by the Light", a cover of a Bruce Springsteen song by Manfred Mann's Earth Band, contains what has been called "probably the most misheard lyric of all time". The phrase "revved up like a deuce", altered from Springsteen's original "cut loose like a deuce", is frequently misheard as "wrapped up like a douche". Springsteen himself has joked about the phenomenon.

Another commonly cited example of a song susceptible to mondegreens is Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit", with the line "here we are now, entertain us" variously being misinterpreted as "here we are now, in containers" and "here we are now, hot potatoes", among other renditions.

In the 2014 song "Blank Space" by Taylor Swift, listeners widely misheard the line "got a long list of ex-lovers" as "all the lonely Starbucks lovers".

Rap and hip-hop lyrics may be particularly susceptible to being misheard because they do not necessarily follow standard pronunciations. The delivery of rap lyrics relies heavily upon an often-regional pronunciation or non-traditional accenting (see African-American Vernacular English) of words and their phonemes to adhere to the artist's stylizations and the lyrics' written structure. This issue is exemplified in controversies over alleged transcription errors in Yale University Press's 2010 Anthology of Rap.

Standardized and recorded mondegreens

Sometimes, the modified version of a lyric becomes standard, as is the case with "The Twelve Days of Christmas". The original has "four colly birds" (colly means black); by the turn of the twentieth century, these had been replaced by calling birds, which is the lyric used in the now-standard 1909 Frederic Austin version. Another example is found in ELO's song "Don't Bring Me Down". The original recorded lyric was "don't bring me down, Gruss!", but fans misheard it as "don't bring me down, Bruce!". Eventually, ELO began playing the song with the mondegreen lyric.

The song "Sea Lion Woman", recorded in 1939 by Christine and Katherine Shipp, was performed by Nina Simone under the title "See Line Woman". According to liner notes, the correct title of this playground song might also be "See \[the] Lyin' Woman" or "C-Line Woman". Jack Lawrence's misinterpretation of the French phrase "pauvre Jean" ("poor John") as the identically pronounced "pauvres gens" ("poor people") led to the translation of La Goualante du pauvre Jean ("The Ballad of Poor John") as "The Poor People of Paris", a hit song in 1956.

In literature

A Monk Swimming by Malachy McCourt is so titled because of a childhood mishearing of a phrase from the Catholic rosary prayer, Hail Mary. "Amongst women" became "a monk swimmin'".

The title and plot of the short science fiction story "Come You Nigh: Kay Shuns" ("Com-mu-ni-ca-tions") by Lawrence A. Perkins deals with securing interplanetary radio communications by encoding them with mondegreens.

Olive, the Other Reindeer is a 1997 children's book by Vivian Walsh, which borrows its title from a mondegreen of the line "all of the other reindeer" in the song "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer". The book was adapted into an animated Christmas special in 1999.

The travel guidebook series Lonely Planet is named after the misheard phrase "lovely planet" sung by Joe Cocker in Matthew Moore's song "Space Captain".

In film

A monologue of mondegreens appears in the 1971 film Carnal Knowledge. The camera focuses on actress Candice Bergen laughing as she recounts various phrases that fooled her as a child, including "Round John Virgin" (instead of "'Round yon virgin...") and "Gladly, the cross-eyed bear". The title of the 2013 film Ain't Them Bodies Saints is a misheard lyric from a folk song; director David Lowery decided to use it because it evoked the "classical, regional" feel of 1970s rural Texas.

In the 1994 film The Santa Clause, a child identifies a ladder that Santa uses to get to the roof from its label: The Rose Suchak Ladder Company. He states that this is "just like the poem", misinterpreting "out on the lawn there arose such a clatter" from A Visit from St. Nicholas as "Out on the lawn, there's a Rose Suchak ladder".

In television

Mondegreens have been used in many television advertising campaigns, including:

* A 2012 Volkswagen Passat advertisement showing people singing incorrect versions of the line "Burning out his fuse up here alone" from "Rocket Man", until a woman listening in a Passat realizes the correct words.
* A 2002 T-Mobile advertisement showing Catherine Zeta-Jones helping to correct a man who has misunderstood the chorus of Def Leppard's "Pour Some Sugar On Me" as "pour some shook up ramen".
* A series of Maxell audio cassette advertisements (1989–1990) featuring misheard versions of "Israelites" and "Into the Valley" as heard by users of other brands of tape.
* A 1987 series of Kellogg's Nut 'n Honey Crunch advertisements featuring a joke in which "Nut 'N' Honey" is misheard as "Nothing, honey".

In video games

Super Mario 64 involved a mishearing during Mario's encounters with Bowser. Charles Martinet explained the line was "So long, King-a Bowser"; however, it was misheard as "So long, gay Bowser". The misinterpreted line became a meme, in part popularized by the line's removal in some updated rereleases of the game.

Other Mario series games also involve mondegreens. Wario's voice line when he loses a minigame or race has been heard by many as the German phrase "So ein Mist!" although Charles Martinet later clarified different aspects of the recordings.

In Final Fantasy XIV, the lyrics for the boss theme "Ultima" are "Beat, the heart of Sabik" but the English-speaking audience heard the voice lines as "big fat tacos" instead. This resulted in fan remixes and the developer embracing the joke, making tacos a plot point in the expansion Dawntrail.

Other notable examples

The traditional game "Telephone" (or "Gossip") involves mishearing a whispered sentence to produce successive mondegreens that gradually distort the original sentence as it is repeated. Among schoolchildren in the US, daily rote recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance has long provided opportunities for the genesis of mondegreens.

Speech-to-text functionality in modern smartphone messaging apps and search or assist functions may be hampered by faulty speech recognition. It has been noted that in text messaging, users often leave uncorrected mondegreens as a joke or puzzle for the recipient to solve. This wealth of mondegreens has proven to be a fertile ground for study by speech scientists and psychologists.

Notable collections

The classicist and linguist Steve Reece has collected examples of English mondegreens in song lyrics, religious creeds and liturgies, commercials and advertisements, and jokes and riddles. He has used this collection to shed light on the process of "junctural metanalysis" during the oral transmission of the ancient Greek epics, the Iliad and Odyssey.

Reverse mondegreen

A reverse mondegreen is the intentional production, in speech or writing, of words or phrases that seem to be gibberish but disguise meaning. A prominent example is "Mairzy Doats" (1943), a novelty song whose lyrics are a reverse mondegreen composed of same-sounding words or phrases (sometimes called "oronyms"). The bridge of the song reveals the intended meaning: "Mares eat oats and does eat oats and little lambs eat ivy."

Deliberate mondegreen

Two authors have written books of supposed foreign-language poetry that are actually mondegreens of nursery rhymes in English: Luis van Rooten's pseudo-French Mots D'Heures: Gousses, Rames and John Hulme's Mörder Guss Reims. Both titles sound like the phrase "Mother Goose Rhymes" and include critical apparatus.

Mozart produced a similar effect in his canon "Difficile Lectu", which, though ostensibly in Latin, is actually an opportunity for scatological humor in both German and Italian.

Some performers and writers have used deliberate mondegreens to create double entendres. The phrase "if you see Kay" (F-U-C-K) has been employed many times, notably in James Joyce's Ulysses.

"Mondegreen" is a song by Yeasayer on their 2010 album Odd Blood; the lyrics are intentionally obscure and spoken hastily to encourage the mondegreen effect.

Anguish Languish, an ersatz language created by Howard L. Chace, is based on homophonic transformations of English words and consists entirely of deliberate mondegreens. A notable example is "Ladle Rat Rotten Hut" ("Little Red Riding Hood").

Lady Gaga's "Poker Face" allegedly replaces every second repetition of "poker face" with "fuck her face" in the artist's delivery.

Related phenomena include:

* Earworm
* Eggcorn
* Holorime
* Homophonic translation
* Hypercorrection
* Phono-semantic matching
* Spoonerism
* Syntactic ambiguity

Non-English languages

The phenomenon exists across many languages and cultures. Examples include mishearings in Serbo-Croatian, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Japanese (soramimi), Mandarin, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, and Yiddish. Notable local terms and examples (such as Dutch "Mama appelsap" or Hebrew "avatiach") illustrate how mondegreens adapt to different phonologies and cultural contexts.
