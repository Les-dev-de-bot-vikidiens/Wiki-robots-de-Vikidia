A bassist (also known as a bass player or bass guitarist) is a musician who plays a [bass instrument](/broken/pages/b1d78a5dd8488f54d224af1e29ab0fca0bdd6908) such as a [double bass](/broken/pages/3bba85630cb4cbc4941902ac9d3046b92f194628) (upright bass, contrabass, wood bass), [bass guitar](/broken/pages/05d6dbc948b04b2f5b2ff1bd7c1a4a2d00c99915) (electric bass, acoustic bass), [keyboard bass](/broken/pages/8d4acf571c51ba82baefa349ec2333b8db5e8330) (synth bass) or a low brass instrument such as a [tuba](/broken/pages/a1def79f352db8ac4a0dec575f0b52f4c9201ae5) or [trombone](/broken/pages/5287bbb3f46f8c2542f4b7cf34ec6f640e0ea9ea). Many [musical genres](/broken/pages/208179e7302c1a2b75ddacb3d5a345d0171fdd86) tend to be associated with at least one or more of these instruments.

## Overview

Since the 1960s, the electric bass has been the standard bass instrument for [funk](/broken/pages/82ba7a9955791b0f4b5e44b0d8c21dec7bc738b0), [R\&B](/broken/pages/836490135879d2e46c9d0f98686daef9f83b3745), [soul](/broken/pages/71021350c259dd2cfa3ad2f24487cdab6a945e52), [rock](/broken/pages/a546bbc21f32936f349dbb00cd48cc770e37e723), [reggae](/broken/pages/acb8693904bc63d16b16dca61785274aff799650), [jazz fusion](/broken/pages/ca0b7389f1019e91ef7793790b0dc3bf97838b94), [heavy metal](/broken/pages/a7ebaadb98bd0fb80f4ae8dcef82a5b70f972979), [country](/broken/pages/c7c422a9eb3ef225ef08027c58bd97ec1116f3e5) and [pop](/broken/pages/aae8e479b164b56d6bdfebf6d5c380d71fa7cc20). The double bass is the standard bass instrument for [classical music](/broken/pages/4265a2c98f0c8b207efbe51ecc662a0db5f49621), [bluegrass](/broken/pages/99c69a89091389c953da2e6ae57ace4ade0ef289), [rockabilly](/broken/pages/66815ce3f986081ce1c8d486ec4054827443bc78), and most genres of [jazz](/broken/pages/9e82eed1c01a0732f1bf41503e3737b488529c91). Low brass instruments such as the tuba or sousaphone are the standard bass instrument in [Dixieland](/broken/pages/c91243085f53f4c7fcd136eccae7db43846a604d) and New Orleans-style jazz bands. Tuba players are sometimes conflated with bassists, due to the instrument being used to double a part for the double bass in early music recordings. Tubists who tend to fill the role of a bassist include [Howard Johnson](/broken/pages/72b91eb8c592737677172e4373e1a5c785321095), [Herbie Flowers](/broken/pages/375fbb808c1401b82197f8e0d4f9c5f6b57c4d19) and [Steve Brown](/broken/pages/de45da80caa7a426f281e41e4479990835a04b25) among others.

Despite the associations of different bass instruments with certain genres, there are exceptions. Some rock bands and bassists used a double bass, such as [Lee Rocker](/broken/pages/2bf3a465b32e3b106096ac67cd0deedf239e9110) of [Stray Cats](/broken/pages/aa7c39ee03931fada63619459373af455184cd27), [Barenaked Ladies](/broken/pages/c099c490e24ffef279fe0a031eca1c86d27ec5e7) and [Tiger Army](/broken/pages/06be852229aedf4359a4c2e02ad5165ea4fa3ed6). [Larry Graham](/broken/pages/cab439caeac37a340237bc952a728e30c232d71e), Bernard Edwards, Mick Hogan, Andy Fraser, and Mel Schacher used an electric bass guitar. Some funk, R\&B and jazz fusion groups use [synth bass](/broken/pages/b48cecc5fbc63c8f9a146a20e626809f8c5638e2) or keyboard bass rather than electric bass. [Stevie Wonder](/broken/pages/481ec3a74185adbdc33f1b0f5c5eed835499dabf), [Bootsy Collins](/broken/pages/22529d7ad2b8f5d8970ce291c0d31183516438ee), and [Bernie Worrell](/broken/pages/d5d90249a469712c1f87f0d4d39869ee2c53304e) have used a synth bass. Some traditional jazz bands use double bass or electric bass instead of a tuba; [Bill Johnson](/broken/pages/8074d75293afb5496ce345847b86e0d5e9accc77) and Steve Brown were early double bassists in the New Orleans traditional jazz genre. In some jazz groups and [jam bands](/broken/pages/c425a801ed6b3bc6412503f4888e42ed478082ce), the basslines are played by a [Hammond organ](/broken/pages/eb7f89a89076529d45b2ebb61f9b63199f0d1651) player, who uses the bass [pedal keyboard](/broken/pages/5465479c7734f1e023d03c4705058ecde0cea633) or the lower manual for the low notes. Keyboard driven bass also occurs occasionally in rock bands, such as [Atomic Rooster](/broken/pages/98b0ab418c00d2fdd8503cef7bb9ce35ce718173), and [the Doors](/broken/pages/eb06763b8e70b0c20fdf4b75576cd9a4d832324e) whose keyboardist [Ray Manzarek](/broken/pages/f57237e528808ee88a6d322185b0264f15c4701b) notably used a [Fender Rhodes](/broken/pages/5c9cff8015f57a133e9ce4a223cd053278933af7) piano bass with his left hand.

## Electric bass players

Electric bassists play the bass guitar. In most rock, pop, metal and country genres, the [bass line](/broken/pages/a2b75d13ad35b278b1f8459e565d46c3e464cd1d) outlines the [harmony](/broken/pages/295d0de40d49116ab8a1ca76f7be84afe1857b8e) of the music being performed, while simultaneously indicating the rhythmic pulse. In addition, there are many different standard bass line types for different genres and types of song (e.g. blues ballad, fast swing, etc.).

Bass lines often emphasize the root note, with a secondary role for the third, and fifth of each [chord](/broken/pages/3c0640a9e414b9b500bd639567ef02d08a97defd) being used in a given song. In addition, [pedal tones](/broken/pages/2210b0c230ff159e6a57ee1c1170dc8ae9ad7d27) (repeated or sustained single notes), [ostinatos](/broken/pages/61b51caa9dfb2e9171b1b66515b9935f1fa20234), and bass [riffs](/broken/pages/d98876cc45a78385fa1deca866c9823ee92c2569) are also used as bass lines. While most electric bass players rarely play [chords](/broken/pages/3c0640a9e414b9b500bd639567ef02d08a97defd) (three or more notes all sounded at the same time), chords are used in some styles, especially [funk](/broken/pages/82ba7a9955791b0f4b5e44b0d8c21dec7bc738b0), [R\&B](/broken/pages/836490135879d2e46c9d0f98686daef9f83b3745), soul music, [jazz](/broken/pages/9e82eed1c01a0732f1bf41503e3737b488529c91), rock, [Latin](/broken/pages/094230f7d86718de892ef7e46548de66a60de129) and [heavy metal music](/broken/pages/a7ebaadb98bd0fb80f4ae8dcef82a5b70f972979). [Phil Lesh](/broken/pages/521179628d3ba6f2b7bca3276edf81d2cac31a2b), a bassist for the rock band [Grateful Dead](/broken/pages/fc6a3430154bbf6e5778bd6a518ec6ebabde1131) was known for treating bass lines as counterparts, rather than emphasizing the root note. [Lemmy Kilmister](/broken/pages/1d2e3a63408dceae97aabc98ef4c9893e3415699), bassist for rock bands [Hawkwind](/broken/pages/b472cd08cd294d0a94d2ce490cfa0dd8fb351961) and [Motörhead](/broken/pages/5dbb010f779d7cd47b8925144ff17760b6b9e5b4), was described by some musicians and writers to have a playing style reminiscent of an acoustic guitarist, sometimes using chords.
