A thaler, or taler (/ˈtɑːlər/ TAH-lər; German: Taler \[ˈtaːlɐ], previously spelled Thaler), is one of the large silver coins minted in the states and territories of the Holy Roman Empire and the Habsburg monarchy during the Early Modern period. A thaler-size silver coin has a diameter of about 40 mm (1+1⁄2 in) and a weight of about 25 to 30 grams (roughly 1 ounce). The word is shortened from Joachimsthaler, the original thaler coin minted in Joachimsthal (Jáchymov), Bohemia, from 1520.

While the first standard coin of the Holy Roman Empire was the Guldengroschen of 1524, its longest-lived coin was the Reichsthaler, which contained 1⁄9 Cologne Mark of fine silver (25.984 g) and was issued in various versions from 1566 to 1875. From the 17th century a lesser-valued North German thaler currency unit emerged, which by the 19th century became par with the Vereinsthaler.

Thaler-type silver coins continued to be minted into the 20th century in forms such as the Mexican peso (until 1914), the Swiss five-franc coin (until 1928), the U.S. silver dollar (until 1935), and the Austrian Maria Theresa thaler. Today thaler-sized silver coins are minted by government mints as bullion or numismatic items. The modern derivative name dollar (first Spanish and now mostly English) survives as the name of several modern currencies.

### Etymology

German taler is recorded from the 1530s, as an abbreviation of Joachimstaler. The silver mines at Joachimstal had opened in 1516, and the first such coins were minted there in 1518. The original spelling was taler (so Alberus 1540). German -taler means "of the valley" (cf. Neanderthaler) — cognate with English "dale".

By the late 16th century, the word was variously spelled taler, toler, thaler, thaller; Low German daler, dahler. In 18th–19th-century German orthography, Thaler became standard, changed to Taler in the 1902 spelling reform.

The name taler/thaler was soon used in compounds denoting various types of silver coins of thaler size, e.g. Reichstaler (1566), Silbertaler, Albertustaler (1612), Laubthaler (1726), Kronenthaler (1755), Ortsthaler, Schützentaler, Bankthaler, Speciethaler, etc.

Units in the Netherlands included the daalder, rijksdaalder and leeuwendaalder. From 1754, many German states used the Conventionsthaler as well as a lower-valued North German thaler (or Reichsthaler) worth 3⁄4 Conventionsthaler. From 1840 the various North German thalers converged to the value of the Prussian thaler and afterwards the Vereinsthaler.

The Low German word was adopted in English as daler by 1550, modified to dollar by about 1600. English thaler was introduced in the first half of the 19th century to refer to coins of the German states, as "dollar" became increasingly understood to mean the United States dollar.

### Predecessors

The development of large silver coins is an innovation of the beginning Early Modern period. The largest medieval silver coins were groats (Groschen), from denarius grossus, "thick penny", rarely exceeding six grams. Debasement during the Great Bullion Famine of the 15th century reduced silver content in many small coins drastically.

The trend reversed with discovery of new silver deposits from the 1470s. Italy introduced larger silver coinage (e.g., Venetian lira tron of 1472). In 1484 Archduke Sigismund of Tirol issued a half Guldengroschen (\~15 g). In 1486, with silver from Schwaz and his mint at Hall, Sigismund issued the first true thaler-sized coin, the Guldengroschen. It was widely copied across states with silver supplies.

Electrotype copy of a 1525 Joachimsthaler of the Kingdom of Bohemia. The obverse shows St Joachim; the reverse shows the Bohemian Lion and the name of King Louis.

By 1518, guldiners of similar weight to guldengroschen were appearing across central Europe. In Bohemia, a similarly sized but slightly less fine coin was named Joachimsthaler, from the silver mined near Joachimsthal (Jáchymov). Saint Joachim and the Bohemian lion were portrayed on the coin. Similar coins were minted in neighbouring valleys and became generally known as thaler in German and tolar in Czech. In the 17th century, some Joachimsthalers circulated in the Tsardom of Russia as yefimok (ефимок), a distortion of Joachim.

### Holy Roman Empire

Further information: Reichsthaler, North German thaler, Conventionsthaler

The new large silver coins of the 16th century were named Thaler in German (crown in England, écu in France). The Spanish eight-real coin (peso, Spanish dollar) was a thaler-size coin.

The first large silver coin standardized by the Holy Roman Empire was the Guldengroschen (1524) under the Imperial Minting Standard (Reichsmünzfuß): 1⁄8 Cologne Mark of silver (29.232 g), fineness 0.9375. Its longest-lasting standard coin was the Reichsthaler (1566), containing 1⁄9 Cologne Mark of fine silver (25.984 g). It was produced for the next 300 years at varying rates to the Mark.

A North German thaler currency unit of lesser value also existed (worth e.g. 12 to a Mark after 1690, 13⅓ after 1754, and 14 to a Mark by the 1840s). In 1754 the Conventionsthaler (10 to a Mark) was developed by the Austrian Empire and adopted by many German states, while Scandinavia and some North German states retained the Reichsthaler specie of 9¼ to a Mark as standard until 1875.

#### City view thalers and lösers

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Germany-Hamburg-1679-Half_Bankportugal%C3%B6ser-5_ducats.jpg/330px-Germany-Hamburg-1679-Half_Bankportugal%C3%B6ser-5_ducats.jpg)](/broken/pages/1d28b297dc8dac881982d855561d9eab1947eadd)

The "city view" thalers of the 17th and 18th centuries have predecessors in stylised city representations on late 16th-century thalers (e.g., Lüneburg thaler of Rudolf II, 1584). More elaborate city views appeared in the early 17th century and continued into the 18th century, culminating in detailed panoramas in one-point perspective.

In the late 16th and 17th centuries there was a fashion for oversized "multiple thalers" called Löser in Germany. First minted in the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg, some reached the size of sixteen normal thalers (over 450 g and >12 cm diameter). Löser were often not circulated and are rare, well-preserved collector items.

### Dutch Republic

Maria Theresa Kronenthaler, 1770

The Spanish Netherlands and the Dutch Republic minted large silver coins separately from the Holy Roman Empire. They issued the kruisdaalder (1567) and the leeuwendaalder (lion thaler, 1575; weight 27.68 g, 0.743 fineness). The Dutch rijksdaalder (1583) weighed 29.03 g, 0.885 fineness, and featured William the Silent. Various provinces minted rijksdaalders until the end of the 17th century.

Depreciation of small denominations accelerated from the 1570s; leeuwendaalder rose from 32 to 40 stuivers by 1619, and rijksdaalder from 42 to 50 stuivers. The Amsterdam Wisselbank (Bank of Amsterdam), founded 1608, fixed the rijksdaalder (29.03 g, 0.875 fine; 25.4 g fine silver) at 50 stuivers (2½ gulden), aiding Dutch financial prominence in the 17th century. The Netherlands exported leeuwendaalders widely; their legacy survives in the Romanian and Moldovan leu.

Lion daalders circulated across Europe, Africa, the Middle East and early North America. The lion daalder is cited as influential in American monetary history as a root of the word "dollar." (Source cited in original: coinsandart.com)

By the 18th century the Dutch territories under Spanish control became the Austrian Netherlands. In 1754 the kronenthaler (29.45 g, 0.873 fineness; 25.71 g fine silver) was issued and adopted by many South German states. The term daalder continued to refer to 1½ gulden in currency even after discontinuation of a 1½-gulden coin.

The rijksdaalder (silver ducat) is still minted as a collectors' item in the Netherlands.

### Spain and France

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Philip_V_Coin_silver%2C_8_Reales_Mexico.jpg/250px-Philip_V_Coin_silver%2C_8_Reales_Mexico.jpg)](/broken/pages/4121279eedc7671283b85282966a6c8eb8af0dcf)

The Spanish eight-real coin (spanish dollar) and French écu (example: 1 écu 1784)

Discovery of massive silver in Spanish America in the 1530s enabled large-scale minting of Spain's eight-real coin (27.47 g, 0.9306 fine). Being nearly identical to the German reichsthaler, British colonists called the Spanish coin the dollar; it became the model for the U.S. and Canadian dollars.

German and Spanish dollars lessened demand for French francs and testoons. In 1641 Louis XIII introduced a Louis d’Argent equal to the Spanish dollar (worth three livres tournois; 27.19 g, 0.917 fine). In 1726 France issued its own thaler coin, the silver écu (six livres, \~26.7 g fine silver), which circulated in Southern Germany and Switzerland as the laubthaler. The French franc was established in 1795; the five-franc coin (25.0 g, 90% silver) matched thaler sizes and later featured in the Latin Monetary Union (1865).

### Switzerland

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/LaubtalerGegenstempel.jpg/250px-LaubtalerGegenstempel.jpg)](/broken/pages/6e87e84960d88e1f4e1fa176bcabd254573438c2)

French écu (laubthaler) counterstamped "40 BZ" in Bern became 4 francs under the Helvetic Republic.

Swiss cantons each minted coins, with larger silver coins conforming to German or French standards. Thaler and half-thaler coins were minted by Zürich (1512), Bern, Lucerne, Zug, Basel, Fribourg, Solothurn, Schaffhausen, St. Gallen and Geneva.

Reformed cities represented "city views" on thalers rather than patron saints or princes; Zürich's first city view thaler (Vögelitaler) was minted in 1651.

By the 18th century Bern and many western Swiss cantons adopted the French écu (laubthaler, 26.7 g fine silver) valued at 4 livres (francs) or 40 batzen of Bern. In 1798 the Helvetic Confederation adopted this system with the first Swiss franc equal to 1⁄4 écu.

Transition to the Swiss franc stalled while public preference shifted to the South German Kronenthaler (25.71 g fine silver) valued at 3.9 francs or 39 batzen. In 1850 Switzerland established the modern Swiss franc at par with the French franc; 40 Swiss francs were exchanged for seven kronenthaler. The five-franc coin (25.0 g, 90% silver) was closest in value to historical thalers.

### Scandinavia

See also: Danish rigsdaler, Norwegian speciedaler, Swedish riksdaler

The name thaler was introduced to Scandinavia as daler. The first Swedish daler coins were minted in 1534; the Norwegian speciedaler was minted from 1560. Later Scandinavian daler coins included the Swedish riksdaler (1604) and Danish rigsdaler (1625). In the early 19th century these countries introduced modern currencies based on the daler unit; Norway chose speciedaler as the currency name in 1816.

Denmark and Sweden replaced daler currencies with the Danish krone and Swedish krona in 1873 (Scandinavian Monetary Union). Norway joined and introduced the Norwegian krone in 1876.

### 19th-century Germany

At the start of the 19th century the South German states valued the Conventionsthaler at 2.4 South German gulden (9.744 g fine silver per gulden). They then began to mint the Kronenthaler valued at 2.7 gulden (reduced fine silver content per gulden). In 1837 the Prussian thaler was fixed at 1.75 South German gulden (9.545 g fine silver per gulden).

The North German thaler (3⁄4 Conventionsthaler) was revalued in the 1840s at par with the Prussian thaler (14 to a Mark). In 1857 the Vereinsthaler (worth one North German thaler or 1.75 South German gulden) was adopted as the standard coin by most German states and the Habsburg Empire; Vereinsthalers were issued until 1871 in Germany and 1867 in Austria.

Within the German Empire, silver Vereinsthaler coins remained unlimited legal tender at three German gold marks until 1908 when they were withdrawn and demonetized. Some old countermarked thalers circulated as emergency coinage in Germany during the post–World War I inflation.

The Maria Theresa thaler (Conventionsthaler standard, minted 1751 onwards), continued to be minted after Maria Theresa's death (coins after 1780 always show the year 1780). It served as an official trade coin in many regions and remained important in Ethiopia (Ethiopian birr introduced at par with it), the Horn of Africa, Eastern Africa, India and much of the Arabian Peninsula.

### Legacy

Swiss 5 francs coin, 25.0 grams, 90% silver

Various silver thaler coins were minted across Europe until the 1870s, though often counted in non-thaler currency units (guilders, francs, reales). By the mid-19th century the thaler (reichsthaler, rigsdaler) remained a currency unit in the North German Confederation and Scandinavia. By 1875 the thaler disappeared as a currency unit in Europe upon adoption of the gold standard.

Outside Europe the thaler continued in forms such as the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, other Spanish American pesos, and the Ethiopian birr. The word thaler (and its variants) survived as informal names for coins equivalent to historical coins (e.g., German three-mark coin, Dutch 2½-gulden coin, five-franc coins of the Latin Monetary Union, Greek five-drachma coin (τάληρο)).

Thaler-sized coins to late-19th-century standards were minted until 1914 in Mexico and most of Europe, until 1928 in Switzerland, and until 1934 in the United States. Afterwards thaler-sized coins have been minted mainly as bullion or numismatic pieces, including:

* The Maria Theresa thaler trade coin
* Modern silver commemorative Talers in German-speaking Europe (e.g. Swiss Schützentaler, Helvetia-Taler; Austrian Haller-Taler)
* The American Silver Eagle (1 troy ounce, 31 g fine silver), which is heavier than the original silver dollar

The term survives in the name dollar across many modern currencies (e.g., Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand, United States) and in forms like the Samoan tālā and the Slovenian tolar (before the euro).
