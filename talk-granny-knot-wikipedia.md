## Talk: Granny knot — Discussion (excerpts)

<details>

<summary>Comments</summary>

Is this supposed to be funny? You tie shoes with a "double slipped reef knot". A granny is a mistake in this application.

But you can turn a granny into a clove hitch and a clove hitch into a granny. No I don't know why. — [Ortolan88](/broken/pages/fdaf9ccddfa64bbe187d2036ee36daa900ec3bd1)

<summary>is the person crazy?</summary>

how come the granny is praticaly the same knot as the square knot? is the knots the same with just different names or did the person who invented knots wanted to be crazy? — Preceding unsigned comment by [72.76.88.242](/broken/pages/2944233136de5b90a33f4f96190e4584be7a5f9c)

Responses:

* [Dfred](/broken/pages/0000ee6a777e4797289d9b08bae1c60c0e783a68) (15:44, 6 May 2007): Both the square knot and the granny knot are extremely ancient. Though they appear similar, the two different knots have quite distinct properties.
* \[71.35.171.166] (21:34, 30 March 2008): They're actually two different knots; most people use a granny knot to tie stuff together but it can be pulled out, while with a square or reef knot you often have to rip through the rope.

<summary>Physics</summary>

Intuitively, the granny knot can slip more easily than the reef (square) knot and also jam. The reef knot has symmetry along the line of tension; the granny knot does not, so under tension the knot can rotate and lose friction. Over long use this twist can fray rope fibers.

Questions raised:

* Where can a physical analysis of these behaviors be found?
* Should Wikipedia compare knots with referenced physical analyses, including rope type?

Replies:

* \[Decoy] (17:19, 18 June 2010) asked for systematic exposition.
* \[Dfred] (16:03, 24 June 2010) noted experimental reproducibility is difficult and cited The History and Science of Knots (J. C. Turner & Pieter van de Griend, eds.) as a useful reference: http://www.worldcat.org/title/history-and-science-of-knots/oclc/33243587\&referer=brief\_results (ISBN 9810224699).
* Other contributors noted mixed practical experiences: one commenter found a granny superior for some tasks because a square knot can deform into a slip when tension is applied to one rope.

<summary>Etymology</summary>

Discussion about the article's etymology claim (origin from "granary"):

* \[PierreAbbat] (07:44, 25 November 2019) observed interlanguage links suggest meanings like "grandmother's knot" or "old wives' knot", not "granary".
* \[Slashme] (08:49, 25 October 2021) removed the "granary" claim as a folk etymology that doesn't appear in print before about 1990.

<summary>ABoK #3786 is not a Granny Knot</summary>

Comment (1 September 2021): In Ashley Book of Knots (ABoK) it's called "Granny Mesh Knot", and is quite different from the Granny Knot (and much more stable). — contributor from IP 79.218.246.145

A note from the page: "A way to form the Zeppelin knot (some might find this simpler than the Zeppelin knot article description), is to proceed as Granny knot, then at the last 'tuck under', take the right side working-end down between the lower cross over. Finished." — \[JohnsonL623] (08:45, 16 November 2011)
