"Time Is Running Out", a 2012 musique concrète composition by Salakapakka Sound System

Musique concrète (French pronunciation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/French; lit. 'concrete music') is a type of [music composition](/broken/pages/d959b17503c276d5b552cc66de46faf4de1b1c59) that utilizes [recorded sounds](/broken/pages/bc9bd994e33f176f5f22fca6b5c158cce9488d61) as raw material. Sounds are often modified through the application of [audio signal processing](/broken/pages/614ab00be6643b775a70d2b3cd765cfc551798db) and [tape music](/broken/pages/b23db263fd440b787736012b509da8b8c3cf5ac7) techniques, and may be assembled into a form of [sound collage](/broken/pages/76095b4d6116dd7aaca89fec430405d964ed92cc). It can feature sounds derived from recordings of [musical instruments](/broken/pages/91d1f2c4d41dded4af57cd80652c7eb6c11ce20b), the [human voice](/broken/pages/221e1a3e0b903d8eb1317aa036a482a4db3838b3), and the natural environment, as well as those created using sound [synthesis](/broken/pages/ba156376a8a312e982ed946e86367835cfefa6af) and computer-based [digital signal processing](/broken/pages/54e1d5f6be11576c2188ffc0e725e851bfa4c1b3). Compositions in this idiom are not restricted to the normal musical rules of [melody](/broken/pages/ac0f135744c51d8901cd5ffe5ad301f53cc5c81e), [harmony](/broken/pages/e670fca73c97bddd177ff25f37ae028e307d48d0), [rhythm](/broken/pages/fdf1e6d4b03a32fd5b42cc42d67732dc5098f226), and [metre](/broken/pages/b27f0a7b464c965d111570e7aaf1d2bdf48d7295). The technique exploits [acousmatic sound](/broken/pages/26c545dc06c925a7b86721b295c3e50b3495c64b), such that sound identities can often be intentionally obscured or appear unconnected to their source cause.

The theoretical basis of musique concrète as a compositional practice was developed by French composer [Pierre Schaeffer](/broken/pages/dc68ad089f76d694ef5e6a2153f5f5bed28fd458), beginning in the early 1940s. It was largely an attempt to differentiate between music based on the abstract medium of notation and that created using so-called [sound objects](/broken/pages/ace7f5865bfb528cf2876a3e5739267862cfbb8c) (French: l'objet sonore). By the early 1950s, musique concrète was contrasted with "pure" elektronische Musik as developed in [West Germany](/broken/pages/d969cf36bbf550360f5f174fb00590be4a78f533) — based solely on the use of electronically produced sounds rather than recorded sounds — but the distinction has since been blurred such that the term "electronic music" covers both meanings. Schaeffer's work resulted in the establishment of France's Groupe de Recherches de Musique Concrète (GRMC), which attracted important figures including [Pierre Henry](/broken/pages/8784661bb3565596ff320a443fee8d98c4e81b04), [Luc Ferrari](/broken/pages/0a1f36d6344ca562cc679f57331b406df7acb38c), [Pierre Boulez](/broken/pages/31cc9378d93042dc4e85c479d982d100e38aeea7), [Karlheinz Stockhausen](/broken/pages/be7abf6c7494ce72d15473a217c1994548e293df), [Edgard Varèse](/broken/pages/d351d6436d4b91edb01ab82427a3d6f003020add), and [Iannis Xenakis](/broken/pages/0bc186caedbc3ad63efd67c04ecc0b4922ef5acd). From the late 1960s onward, and particularly in France, the term [acousmatic music](/broken/pages/c6ad5edcfe757a652ca9dff0c7dc31d63f490ba3) (French: musique acousmatique) was used in reference to fixed media compositions that utilized both musique concrète–based techniques and live sound spatialisation.

## History

### Beginnings

In 1928, music critic André Cœuroy wrote in his book, Panorama of Contemporary Music, that "perhaps the time is not far off when a composer will be able to represent through recording, music specifically composed for the [gramophone](/broken/pages/1a070aa8ed086012cde81144ed57c47e0c001cb8)". Around the same period, composers and theorists (including Henry Cowell, Nikolai Lopatnikoff, Igor Stravinsky, Boris de Schloezer, and Rudolf Arnheim) speculated about the creative possibilities of recorded sound and radio. Possible antecedents to musique concrète include Walter Ruttmann's film Wochenende (1930), which introduced recordings of environmental sound to represent the urban soundscape of Berlin; Irwin Bazelon referred to a sound collage in the film Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) as "pre-musique concrète". Ottorino Respighi's Pines of Rome (1924) calls for a phonograph recording of birdsong to be played during the third movement.

### Pierre Schaeffer and Studio d'Essai

In 1942, Pierre Schaeffer joined Jacques Copeau and his pupils in founding the [Studio d'Essai](/broken/pages/0adc6030a0c9b46d8a26c178e7ef50c127eb6aaf) de la Radiodiffusion Nationale. The studio originally functioned as a center for the French Resistance on radio and in August 1944 was responsible for the first broadcasts in liberated Paris. It was here that Schaeffer began experimenting with creative radiophonic techniques using the sound technologies of the time. In 1948, Schaeffer began to keep journals describing his attempt to create a "symphony of noises"; these journals were published in 1952 as A la recherche d'une musique concrète. Schaeffer was driven by a desire to construct music from concrete objects and to find a vocabulary or method upon which to ground such music.

Schaeffer's practice was influenced by voice actors, microphone usage, radiophonic art, and cinema—particularly the recording and montage techniques of cinematography—which served as a substrate for musique concrète. Jean Epstein's writings on the transposition of natural sounds and their musical possibilities influenced Schaeffer's concept of reduced listening.

### Halim El-Dabh

As a student in Cairo in the early to mid-1940s, Egyptian composer [Halim El-Dabh](/broken/pages/bbc5c52e006c980412725fd2e56eb58f65ee3e36) experimented with electroacoustic music using a wire recorder. He recorded an ancient zār ceremony and processed the material (reverberation, echo, voltage controls, re-recording) to create the tape-based composition The Expression of Zaar (presented in 1944). El-Dabh later gained recognition for his work at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in the late 1950s.

### Club d'Essai and Cinq études de bruits

Following Schaeffer's work at Studio d'Essai, the studio was renamed Club d'Essai de la Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française in 1946. In 1948 Schaeffer initiated "research into noises" at the Club d'Essai and on 5 October 1948 premiered five works for phonograph known collectively as Cinq études de bruits (Five Studies of Noises), including Étude violette and Étude aux chemins de fer.

### Musique concrète (term and aesthetic)

By 1949, Schaeffer's compositional work was publicly known as musique concrète. Schaeffer explained the term as pointing out an opposition with traditional composition: instead of notating ideas for known instruments, the question was to collect concrete sounds from wherever they came and abstract the musical values they potentially contained. Pierre Henry described musique concrète as focused on envelopes and forms and as a new mental framework of composing. Schaeffer's aesthetic centered on using sound as a primary compositional resource and emphasized the importance of play (jeu) in sound-based composition.

## Groupe de Recherche de Musique Concrète

By 1951 the work of Schaeffer, Pierre Henry, and sound engineer Jacques Poullin received official recognition and the Groupe de Recherches de Musique Concrète (GRMC) was established at RTF in Paris. The GRMC established the first purpose-built electroacoustic music studio and attracted notable composers such as Olivier Messiaen, Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Edgard Varèse, Iannis Xenakis, and others. Output from 1951–1953 included works by Boulez, Messiaen, Stockhausen, Henry, Philippot, Barraqué, and collaborations by Schaeffer/Henry.

Schaeffer later created a new collective, Groupe de Recherches Musicales (GRM), recruiting members including Michel Chion, Luc Ferrari, Beatriz Ferreyra, François-Bernard Mâche, Iannis Xenakis, Bernard Parmegiani, and Mireille Chamass-Kyrou. GRM worked under the Service de la Recherche at ORTF (1960–1974) alongside other research groups devoted to production and creation; the teaching motto at GRM was "do and listen". From 1966 François Bayle directed GRM for thirty-one years.

## Traité des objets musicaux

Schaeffer strengthened the concept of musique acousmatique (sound heard without seeing its cause). In 1966 he published Traité des objets musicaux (Treatise on Musical Objects), culminating some 20 years of research. A set of sound recordings, Le solfège de l'objet sonore, was produced to exemplify the treatise's concepts.

## Technology

The development of musique concrète was facilitated by post-war music technology: microphones, phonographs, and later magnetic tape recorders enabled Schaeffer and colleagues to experiment with recording and tape manipulation.

## Initial tools of musique concrète

In 1948 a typical radio studio included shellac record players and recorders, a mixing desk with rotating potentiometers, mechanical reverberation units, filters, and microphones. These tools allowed operations such as:

* Shellac record players: play forwards/reverse, change speed (limited transposition).
* Shellac recorder: record the output of the mixing desk.
* Mixing desk: mix several sources with independent gain control; route signals to filters/reverb.
* Mechanical reverberation: metal plates or springs creating artificial reverb.
* Filters: third-octave banks and high/low-pass filters to eliminate or enhance frequencies.
* Microphones: essential for capturing sound.

Techniques developed included sound transposition (changing playback speed), sound looping, hand-controlled sample extraction (letting a stylus read a small segment), and filtering to alter or obscure original sounds.

## Magnetic tape

First tape recorders arrived at ORTF in 1949. Early unreliability meant some works were still composed with records, but by 1950 tape editing enabled continuous speed variation, precise splicing, and micrometric junctions. Tape editing led to micromontage: assembling very small fragments to create new sounds or larger structures.

## Development of novel devices

Schaeffer and Poullin developed tools at GRMC, including a three-track tape recorder; the morphophone (ten playback heads for looped tape echo); the phonogène family (keyboard-controlled and sliding devices to play tape loops at variable speeds); and the potentiomètre d'espace (a device for distributing encoded tracks across loudspeakers).

## Phonogène

Speed variation was a powerful sound design tool, affecting length, pitch, attack characteristics, and spectral energy distribution. Phonogènes (first manufactured in 1953) provided means to alter sound structure:

* Chromatic phonogène: keyboard-controlled, multiple capstans provided discrete speeds; worked with short sounds.
* Sliding phonogène (continuous): continuous variation of tape speed using a control rod; could modify any length of tape.
* Universal phonogène (1963): enabled dissociation of pitch variation from time variation (early forms of harmonising and time-stretching), using a rotating magnetic head (Springer temporal regulator).

## Three-head tape recorder

An early machine allowing simultaneous listening of several synchronized sources by superposing three magnetic tapes driven by a common motor. This permitted polyphonic conception and dedicated loudspeaker outputs for each head. Timbres Durées (1952) by Olivier Messiaen was the first work composed for this recorder.

## Morphophone

Designed to build complex forms through repetition, delays, filtering, and feedback. A rotating disk carried looped tape; twelve magnetic heads (recording, erasing, ten playback) read the loop at different delays. Each head had its own amplifier and band-pass filter, enabling varied repetitions, filters, and feedback to produce reverberation or continuous sounds.

## Early sound spatialisation system

At the premiere of Schaeffer's Symphonie pour un homme seul (1951), a spatial control system (relief desk / potentiomètre d'espace) was tested to control dynamics from several shellac players and create stereophonic effects from monophonic sources. Loudspeakers were placed around the audience (front left/right, rear, and suspended above), and a performer could position sounds by moving a small handheld transmitter coil near four receiver coils. This method introduced the notion of controlling music presentation to create a performance situation and remains influential in acousmatic music.

## Coupigny synthesiser and Studio 54 mixing desk

In 1970 GRM created an electronic studio (Studio 54) featuring the Coupigny modular synthesiser (designed by François Coupigny) and a Moog synthesiser. The Coupigny synthesiser and the Studio 54 desk were combined for ease of use by a single composer and influenced GRM's output. Although synthesised sounds had appeared earlier, Schaeffer resisted envelope-controlled synthesisers because they favored preconceived musical structures; the Coupigny was conceived as a sound-event generator with globally controlled parameters suited to continuous and complex intermodulation processes.

## Acousmonium

![Schaeffer presenting the Acousmonium](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Psconcer.jpg/250px-Psconcer.jpg)

François Bayle (who took charge of GRM in 1966) and engineer Jean-Claude Lallemand created the Acousmonium in 1974: an "orchestra of loudspeakers" (50–100 loudspeakers of varying shapes and sizes) for concert presentation of acousmatic works with enhanced spatialisation. Loudspeakers are placed on stage and throughout the venue; a mixing console is used to manipulate placement across the array in a performative technique called sound diffusion. The Acousmonium's purpose is to form an "orchestration" of the acoustic image rather than diffuse sound from circumference to centre. As of 2010, the Acousmonium was still performing with 64 speakers, 35 amplifiers, and 2 consoles.

## In popular music

Some composers used recognisable snippets of music or speech from popular media, reflecting the mediascape of contemporary life. Examples and influences include:

* 1960s: The Beatles incorporated tape loops, speed manipulation, and reverse playback (e.g., "Tomorrow Never Knows", "Strawberry Fields Forever", "I Am the Walrus", "Revolution 9"). Other artists: Jimi Hendrix (noise/feedback), Frank Zappa (collage techniques), Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead (Anthem of the Sun).
* 1970s: Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon (1973) used musique concrète elements (e.g., cash registers on "Money"); Faust's The Faust Tapes (1973); Kraftwerk's "Autobahn" (1975) used a collage of engines and traffic noise. Industrial groups (Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire) continued tape-collage traditions. Brian Eno's ambient work and My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (1981) combined samples and synthesis.
* 1980s onward: Hip hop producers used turntables, sampling, and collage (Grandmaster Flash, Eric B., Public Enemy's Bomb Squad). Art of Noise digitised and synthesised musique concrète (Fairlight CMIs, Akai S1000). Later examples include Matmos, Meat Beat Manifesto, Negativland, and many uses of found sounds or reversed elements in pop and R\&B (Aaliyah, Missy Elliott).
